# Talk in Honor of Monsignor Ignace Sadek

*May 5, 2007*<br/>
*Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral*<br/>
*Brooklyn, NY*

Monsignor Sadek has been for this Cathedral an extra ordinary gift. As he has been in all of his assignments, the Seminary in Lebanon, as Pastor in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania and now as Pastor of the Cathedral, he has left an indelible mark on the lives of those he has served. I know of no other seventy-seven year old priest who is more loved and respected than our own Monsignor Sadek. He has brought dignity and distinction to this Cathedral. I hope and pray that when I reach 77, I can have the same zeal, stamina, love for Christ, desire for holiness that he has. He is eternally young because of his love for Christ and His Church.

When I first came to Brooklyn as Bishop, one of the great personal blessings I experienced, in an otherwise difficult assignment, was to have Monsignor Sadek as Rector of the Cathedral. I have Bishop Doueihi, who assigned him here in 1997, to thank for this gift; and a true gift it has been.

At every liturgical celebration here at the Cathedral I have taken away some lasting spiritual treasure. I will miss his homilies at Noon Daily Liturgy. Each day is like a mini-retreat, as he encourages us to personal holiness. I will miss him personally, as a father, a brother and friend as I know each and every one of you will as well. I thank God that Monsignor has consented to live and serve in our Seminary in Washington D.C., where he will help prepare men for service in the priesthood. It will be a difficult transition for him and this sacrifice we should never take for granted, but I know for a fact that the Seminarians are thrilled with the news that he will assist Chorbishop Beggiani in the Seminary. I hope and pray that the Seminarians would turn out to be priests like him.

Monsignor Sadek, for your life of faithfulness, your priestly zeal for souls, and your personal desire for holiness and goodness, thank you. You have left a permanent mark on all of us. May God bless you, and may God bless America
