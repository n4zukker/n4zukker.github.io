Dear Brother Priests, Beloved Religious and Laity of the Eparchy of St Maron,

We have lost our Father in Christ, Pope John Paul II.

These days have given us, alongside of the entire world, a chance to reflect on just what Pope John Paul has meant to all.

I have watched numerous media reports, which I have found to be simply stunning in elegance and beauty. I will always be so grateful that the media has helped us to tell the world about the good news of Christ and the true beauty of the Catholic Church â€“ even with all its human imperfections.

His writings and even his doctoral dissertation Faith in John of the Cross give us a deeper appreciation as to why he is so unshakeable in matters of doctrine and morality and yet so mystical, perhaps radical, in his views on love, life, human respect and dignity, and the wonder of the world which God has given us.

Together, as we reflect on his generous pastoral ministry among us as a loving father, let us also take the time to know the heart of this father whom we loved so that we might truly appreciate the love he had for us and the Church.

Sincerely yours in Christ


&#10013; Gregory John Mansour
