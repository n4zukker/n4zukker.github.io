Brothers and Sisters all in Christ;

The times in which we live are trying times, but our Lord never leaves us orphaned.The Maronite Church, Lebanon and all who believe in standing for truth no matter what the cost, are doing what is right and good even if unappreciated or misinterpreted, in working for and believing in something greater than themselves – such as one’s country, the Church, the Truth of the Gospel – finds in Patriarch Nasrallah Peter Cardinal Sfeir a Gift from Christ Himself sent to shepherd us in His name.
Difficult times call for extraordinary shepherds. The Maronite Catholic Church has such a visionary and strong shepherd in the person of Patriarch Sfeir. His brother Cardinal Justin Rigali here present with us tonight is of the same character. With him and in the name of all here present please join me in welcoming his Eminence and Beatitude Patriarch Nasrallah Peter Cardinal Sfeir and thanking God for him.
